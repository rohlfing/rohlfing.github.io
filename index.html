    Shown above is the circuit I used to integrate a  Big-Mouth Billy Bass
    with an Amazon Echo Dot in such a way that the fish would turn its head to
    acknowledge the user (as the ring of lights previously did) and move its
    mouth to lip-sync with spoken words. See my video
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzcQi6uH7PU">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is not an original project idea; there are multiple more examples on
    YouTube (and Amazon recently released a talking-fish-shaped bluetooth
    speaker compatible with its Alexa products. However, the only DIY
    explanations and tutorials I could find online required some kind of
    microcontroller and usually a motorcontroller. My solution, however,
    uses only on a couple dozen simple electrical components, nearly all of
    which (with the exception of the 3 BJT transistors) came from a lab kit
    from a college itro-to-circuits class.
    </p>
    <p>
    Below I will attempt to explain the function of various sections of the
    circuit and some of the design considerations that went into them. First,
    though, a disclaimer: I took two learn-about-circuits classes in college
    several years ago. There are likely quite a few probelms with the circuit.
    <span class="emphasis"> If you see something that could be improved or needs
    to be fixed, please leave a note in the comments at the bottom. </span>
    Thanks!

    There are two switches in the schematic, and these correspond to the two
    switches found on the Billy Bass: the push button is the red button on the
    front and the spdt switch is the "On / Sensor" switch on the back of the
    case. The push button is being used to short the audio output of the Echo,
    as my repackaging of the microphone board in the fish voids any of the
    acoustic separation between speaker and mic that Amazon designed in. In
    short, sometimes it is necessary to forcibly mute the speaker to be heard
    by the microphones.
    The SPDT switch changes between modes. In the connection depicted on the
    schematic, the lip-syncing portion of the circuit is only able to drive the
    the mouth motor when the Echo's lights are lit. This means that Alexa's
    words are mouthed by the fish, but music, news, and other pre-recorded
    content are not. In the alternate connection, all sounds activate the
    mouth-moving circuitry. This is what is shown in the YouTube video when
    the fish is speaking words for an NPR reporter.

    The speaker used is the one built into the rear case of the Billy Bass.
    It is driven from the 3.5mm port on the Echo, which are depicted as the
    terminals on the left of the schematic above (top wire is left channel,
    lower is ground). Because of this, the volume is lower than it would be from
    using the Echo on its own. In my tests, volume 10 was moderately loud, and
    anything below 6 was difficult to hear if there was any ambient noise. This
    could potentially be fixed by adding an audio amplifier to the circuit, but
    it is functional as-is, and I was going for simplicity in this design.
